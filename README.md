# r1ruru-My-Personal-Mail-Sender


I have done this using python3.8. This personal mail-sender is able to send messages to the given destination email address. It is also capable to find out the validation of email address and if the email address is valid, it sends the given content to the given destination. Otherwise, It gives more chances to give the email address correctly.
